## How to run

To properly run this site you'd need my API code, which I've yet to make public.
However, it'll still render a skeleton site that you can play with if you wish.

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:scan-lan/lukescanlan.com.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm i
   ```

3. Run the development server

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
